Nicholas Muller
Intro to Web Development Summer 2022

This is a personal website project for Intro to Web Development, it is meant to serve as a website we can use in the future
when looking for jobs or any other professional endeavour. Running the code is done through the index.html file which has
the other two files linked. The site is already deployed and can be viewed at the following address : https://queoui.github.io/

For this project I used bootstrap grid formatting and one of their contact forms. I also used a couple free sites to
make the font icon with my initials as well as the black labels used for my projects section.

Thank you.
